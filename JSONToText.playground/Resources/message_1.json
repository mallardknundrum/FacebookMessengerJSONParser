Like, for me, the view that creationism should be taught in school. I'm very much against that. That view deserves ridicule. So that people know that they are on the wrong side of history. Racists deserve ridicule. Now what one person thinks is racist is relative but generally you get two or three sides stating their views. If someone doesn't agree with anyone then maybe they need to ask themselves if they are also not in an echo chamber or are not willing to listen and are open to having their minds changed.

If someone has a differing opinion, its not right to shame them, degrade them, and try to use \"politically correct\" points of view and groups and movements to bully people who have differing views into silence. Progress cannot be made that way. If you the only people you are listening to and taking seriously are \"someone you trust\" i.e. your friends, who you chose, who you chose because they don't make you uncomfortable by sharing or holding contrary opinions, if those are the only people you're talking to and listening to, then you live in an echo chamber. You will never hear anything that you don't want to hear, and if you do, you are trained by your peer group to dismiss and ridicule them. Not listen. Not understand. Not check if they have something valuable to add to the conversation. Not think about what can be learned from their perspective. You miss out on all this discourse and opportunity for learning and growth for everyone. I think we've lost the art of having civil discussions and i think its causing alienation and isolation. Besides all that, yelling at someone and calling their names is the worst way to try and change their mind. Bullying is not ok ever. It still happens though, and a lot of these movements think its right and encourage it. When someone disagrees why can't we just ask why?",

There's give and take. I believe there are places where AA is effective and others where it over steps. But race is a hugely complex issue and not one that we can just leave to market forces when people's biases come into account. It's a shit sandwich and we deal with it the best way we know how. And then have to adjust. Humans are always going to fuck shit up but like MLK said, The arc of the moral universe is long but bends towards Justice. There is always going to be collateral damage in these situations, but you can't just leave the University of Alabama in the 70's to decide how many blacks they're going to admit. \u00f0\u009f\u00a4\u00b7 You just can't.

I can't understand them like they can. I have not lived them. In the context of \"achiev[ing]\" there is no way to do \"achieve\" without affecting 100% of the population.
